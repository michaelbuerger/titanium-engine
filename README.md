# titanium-engine
This project is a ground-up rewrite of my old OpenGL-based graphics engine (https://github.com/michaelbuerger/GLEngine), using Rust and wgpu. The goal is to create a lightweight and performant engine that enables quick development of tools and simulations I would like to create in the future (2D and 3D). To start I am targeting Linux and Windows.
