# titanium-engine
This project is a ground-up rewrite of my old OpenGL-based graphics engine (https://github.com/michaelbuerger/GLEngine), using Rust and wgpu. The goal is to create a lightweight and performant engine that enables the development of 2D and 3D simulations.

Project goals include:
- Cross-platform (Linux and Windows)
- High performance
- Minimal and carefully chosen dependencies
- Clean architecture
- Emphasis on documentation and testing from the beginning
- "Librarization" --> wrap it up in a nice box and use it wherever needed
